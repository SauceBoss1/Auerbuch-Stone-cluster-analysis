# Clustering Tasks
- Take a look at the data quality and PCA reports and let us know if you have any concerns.
-  Calculate average normalized reads (TMM) of three replicates for each gene in each condition (see below for key). I would like to do a spot check for data fidelity, so please send this file or series of files to Kate and me once you have it before going on to the next step
- Make a master file containing all TMM data for all conditions. I assume you need to make such a file or series of files for the downstream analysis. Please ensure fidelity of gene identity while making this file or series of files. I would also like to do a spot check for data fidelity for this, so please email to Kate and me once you have the file(s) before going on to the next step.
-  Use the elbow method to determine the number of clusters for all 26˚C samples and the number of clusters for all 37˚C samples.
- Generate one heat map of the 26˚C data (4 columns, with each column showing the average of three replicates) and one heat map of the 37˚C data (ditto)
- Generate excel spreadsheet(s) containing the identity of the genes in each cluster
- Meet with Vicki on June 23rd at 3 pm to discuss progress.
- Over the weeks of June 26th and July 3rd, email Vicki and Kate with questions and reports on progress.
- Meet with Vicki between July 10-12 to deliver final analysis and figures.
